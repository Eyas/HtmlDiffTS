# JSDiff

JSDiff represents the JavaScript output for the TypeScript sources. JSDiff
also includes a Demo and Test directories with HTML files that drive both
the demo and the tests.

If you are contributing to this project, please modify the TypeScript files
instead of the JavaScript output.

As a (compiled) derivative of the TypeScript sources, the JavaScript you
see here is also licensed under GNU GPL v2. You may wish to create your
own fork based on the JavaScript sources as such. That said, porting back
modifications to the JavaScript sources to the TypeScript sources in this
repository is appreciated.
